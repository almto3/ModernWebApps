1) What is the meaning of @Entity annotation in Hibernate?

2) What is the purpose of transaction when using Hibernate to interact with
   the database?

3) In hw6, you defined an email system that allowed tagging individual emails.
   Now consider that we want to model the feature that an email can contain 
   zero or more attachments. Using Hibernate, write Entity classes 
   to model this scenario.

4) Using Hibernate, write following queries:
   - Insert an email with one subject and two attachments
     (subject: "Finals", attachment names: "Study material", "class notes")
   - Query all the attachment names for a given email subject.

5) Explain with examples meaning of the following annotations:
   - @ManyToOne, @JoinColumn, @OneToMany(mappedBy="..."), @Column, @Id

6) True or False
   - A detached object is an object that was associated with a session 
     some time in its lifetime.
   - In a REST API, the object into which the input XML is unmarshalled is
     a transient object.
   - Bind parameters are important when using Hibernate.
   - Bind parameters are only relevant and useful in JDBC.
   - Many-to-one annotation should be included on the parent entity
     in the relationship.
   - The owning side of the relationship is the entity that has reference 
     to the other entity.
   - Hibernate entities can be used to represent input/output objects as well
     by using JAXB annotations along side Hibernate annotations
     on entity classes.
