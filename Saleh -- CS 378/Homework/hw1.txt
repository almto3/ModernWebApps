1) Consider the url http://canvas.utexas.edu
   Run following commands and observe the difference between their responses:
   - curl -v -X HEAD http://canvas.utexas.edu
   - curl -v -X HEAD http://canvas.utexas.edu -H "Pragma: no-cache" -H "Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, must-revalidate"
   Experiment with different sites and try to find more sites for which you observe the caching behavior similar to the canvas site.

2) Run following commands and observe their effect on the response:
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Modified-Since: Tue, 30 Aug 2016 17:51:08 GMT"
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Modified-Since: Tue, 29 Aug 2016 17:51:08 GMT"
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Modified-Since: Tue, 31 Aug 2016 17:51:08 GMT"
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-None-Match: \"17a1e7f-6-53b4da01d1629\""
   - curl -v http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~devdatta/test-file.txt -H "If-Match: \"17a1e7f-6-53b4da01d1629\""

3) Find a site that sends back "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" response header. 
   Calculate the size of the content by considering each chunk. 
   Tally it with the size of the content by measuring it independently (using other means such as Unix word count (wc) command)

4) Interact with 5 different sites/urls of your choosing using either curl (or other tools that we discussed in class)
   Make a histogram of response headers (essentially how many sites included each header).
   - Which headers were sent by all sites? Which headers were unique to two or more sites?

5) Read about following headers from the RFCs:
   - Accept-Ranges, Range-Request, Age, max-age, no-store

6) Try out all the programs from HTTP directory in:
