1) What is the difference between primary key and foreign key?

2) What is the difference between natural key and surrogate key?

3) What are some of the advantages of using a natural key as the primary key in a table?

4) What are some of the advantages of using a surrogate key as the primary key in a table?

5) What are bind parameters in context of JDBC?

6) Why is it important to use PreparedStatement with bind parameters when using JDBC? Give precise answer.

7) Consider that we are building an email system in which we want to support a feature where we can attach
   arbitrary tags to emails. An email can have multiple tags and multiple emails can have the same tag.
   For example, consider following three emails with subject and tags.
   Subject               Tags
   Assignment 6          UT, Modern Web apps
   Study group           UT
   Black Friday          Shopping

   Define tables with appropriate columns to enable following queries:
   - Find all emails corresponding to a specific tag
   - Find all tags for a particular email

8) Using JDBC write following queries:
   - Insert an email with following subject and tag ("Finals", "UT")
   - Query email subjects that have the tag "UT"

9) Explain with an example what is a transaction?

10) What mechanism is available in JDBC to obtain the primary key id of an inserted row?

11) What is the difference between executeUpdate and executeQuery JDBC methods?

12) Explain with examples the following - inner join, left outer join, right outer join

13) True or False
    - JDBC code should be added in resource layer when designing a REST API
    - A datasource in JDBC is the place where data is stored
    - We used web.xml to pass JDBC connection parameters to our program so that
      it made the program independent of the specific database used.
