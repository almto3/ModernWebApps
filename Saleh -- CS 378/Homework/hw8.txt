1) What are the key differences between IaaS and PaaS models of cloud computing?

2) Consider a developer's workflow where a developer is developing their web application code.
   During the development phase, one needs to deploy the work-in-progress code often.
   What cloud computing model is suitable for this workflow. Why?

3) Consider an operator's workflow where the operator needs to deploy an already built
   web application to production. What cloud computing model is suitable
   for this workflow. Why?

4) Consider the IaaS model of cloud computing such as Amazon EC2 which allows spinning
   up Virtual Machines in the cloud. Define a REST API to support following operations:
   - Spin up a virtual machine
   - Get information about a spawned virtual machine
   - Stop a spawned virtual machine
   - Delete a spawned virtual machine

5) Consider your assignment 6. Suppose you have set the level of Logger and Handler
   to WARNING. Show the output that will be generated for each of the following calls:
   - Logger.info("Web App is starting up")
   - Logger.config("Web App configuration is a.b.c")
   - Logger.severe("Something severe has happened")

6) Considering the Java logging architecture, what message level would you assign to
   following situations that may happen in your program:
   - Trace message of the program execution that should be displayed only when debugging an issue
   - Exception stack trace
   - Displaying the database credentials that would be used to connect to a database

7) Consider an HTML page as shown below:

<html>
<body>
<div id="myDiv">
  <p id="myP">Click this paragraph</p>
</div><br>

<script>
document.getElementById("myP").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("You clicked the P element!");
}, false);

document.getElementById("myDiv").addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("You clicked the DIV element!");
}, false);
   
</script>
</body>
</html>

This will show a box with the text "Click this paragraph" inside of it.

What messages will be displayed and in what order when you click inside the box
on the "Click this paragraph" text.
